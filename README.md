## About

I am currently a Postdoc in Mathematics in a subfield called `geometric anlaysis'. In my spare time I enjoy learning and doing data analysis. This repository is a collection project I have done over the years. 

## Projects

### Maven Coffee Sales
**Code:** [`Analysis_of_Coffee_Sales`](https://github.com/hwondo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Files/blob/main/Maven_coffee_sales.ipynb)

**Goal:** Understand Sales Trend Across (Fictional) Coffeeshops in New York

**Data:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agungpambudi/trends-product-coffee-shop-sales-revenue-dataset?resource=download

**Description:** This analysis is largely exploratory in nature. We use pandasql to query and manipulate the dataset to produce plots for sales trends across different time scales - hourly, daily and yearly. Averages are taken over the data set for each time scale to obtain the trends of a 'typical' day and week.  

We show a distinctive trend in sales over the year and average total hourly sales. Furthermore, we show strong correlation between similar product types.

### Geospatial and Sentimental Analysis for Seattle Airbnb Dataset

**Code:** [`Analysis_Sattle_Airbnb`](https://github.com/hwondo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Files/blob/main/Seattle_Airbnb_analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** Create a regression model gives recomendations for reservation price. 

**Data:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swsw1717/seatle-airbnb-open-data-sql-project

**Description:** Our analysis shows a difference in revenue generated throughout the year across different neighborhoods. Each trend follows a weekly cycle with peaks corresponding to weekends. The best performing neighborhood group is the miscellaneous group called 'other neighborhood' followed by 'Downtown' throughout the 3 first three months of the 2024 financial year.

Furthermore, we establish autocorrelation in the data using Ridley's K function, the Getis'Ord'G statistical test and a hjeat map using Kernel density estimation. We encode this spatial data into regression models in the following way:
- Model 1: no geometric data. This will be used as a base model to compare our performance.
- Model 2: includes neighborhood group as a categorical variable.
- Model 3: includes neighborhood as a categorical variable
- Model 4: includes cluster groups obtained previously as a categorical variable
- Model 5: includes longitude and latitude as lagged terms in a geometric regression.

In our final regression model, we apply a OLS regression with neighborhood as a categorical variable and sentiment as a continuous variable. Sentiment is calculated from the reviews of each listing. Tested on a validation set, the model produces predictions with a MSE of 0.04517.

### Evaluation of Regression Techniques on Housing Price Data

**Code:** [`Analysis_Housing_Regression`](https://github.com/hwondo/Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Files/blob/main/Housing%20Prices%20Prediction%20Models.ipynb)

**Goal:** Evluate various regression models using a comprehemsive evalaution method by Zhan-Liu-Wu-Zhao-Chow (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417423014835#sec4).

**Data:** https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

**Description:** In this project, we build a variety of industry standard regression models and rank them using a method in "A hybrid machine learning framework for forecasting house price" by Zhan-Liu-Wu-Zhao-Chow (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417423014835#sec4). The standard insutry regression methods we use are:
- Ordinary Least Squares Lasso regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Ada Boosted regression
- Nearest neighbors regression
- Support vector machine.

The evalution method uses 13 evaluation metrics and ranks each model for each metric. The models are then ranked by their mean ranking for each metric. A Friedman and Imanâ€“Davenpor test is used to test for significant variation in the rankings for each model across the evaluation metrics. 

**Results:** Using the evaluation procedure described above, we obtain a 'best' performance model, which in our case is an OLS Lasso model. However, the statistical tests reveal that there is no significant difference in performance of the five standard models used.
